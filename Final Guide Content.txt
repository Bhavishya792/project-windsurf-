Why Recycling and Composting Are Essential
The Growing Waste Crisis
Every year, billions of tons of waste are generated globally, much of which ends up in landfills, emitting harmful greenhouse gases such as methane. Recycling and composting are two of the most effective ways to combat this growing issue.
Environmental Benefits
· Recycling: Conserves natural resources, reduces energy use, and minimizes carbon emissions. For example, recycling one ton of aluminum saves up to 95% of the energy needed to produce it from raw materials.
· Composting: Transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich compost, reducing methane emissions from landfills and improving soil health.
Resource Conservation
Recycling and composting ensure that resources like trees, water, and minerals are preserved, fostering a circular economy where materials are reused instead of discarded.
How to Get Started with Recycling and Composting
Recycling Basics
1. Identify Your Waste: Determine the recyclable materials in your household, such as paper, glass, plastics (check recycling codes), and metals.
2. Set Up a System: Use separate, clearly labeled bins for different materials. This minimizes contamination and simplifies sorting.
3. Know Your Local Guidelines: Recycling rules vary by region. Check your local waste management website for specifics.
4. Reduce and Reuse: Prioritize reducing waste and repurposing items before recycling them.
Composting Basics
1. Choose Your Method: 
o Open Pile: Ideal for large outdoor spaces.
o Closed Bin: Compact and pest-resistant.
o Rotating Tumbler: Speeds up decomposition.
2. Balance Your Ingredients: Maintain a 2:1 ratio of carbon-rich “browns” (leaves, paper) to nitrogen-rich “greens” (food scraps, coffee grounds).
3. Maintain Your Compost: Turn regularly for aeration, keep it moist but not soggy, and monitor for balance.
4. Harvest the Compost: When it’s dark, crumbly, and earthy-smelling, it’s ready to enrich your garden.
Dos and Don’ts of Recycling
Recycling Dos
1. Rinse Containers to Avoid Contamination:
Dirty containers can contaminate an entire recycling batch. Rinse thoroughly to ensure the items can be processed effectively.
2. Flatten Cardboard Boxes to Save Space:
Breaking down boxes helps maximize bin space and makes transportation more efficient at recycling facilities.
3. Remove Staples and Clips from Paper:
Although small, staples and clips can cause issues during paper recycling. Always detach them beforehand.
4. Separate Thin Plastic Bags:
Thin plastic bags can clog recycling machinery. Collect them separately and drop them off at designated recycling points, often found in grocery stores.
5. Recycle Glass Bottles but Remove Lids:
Lids are often made from non-recyclable materials. Removing them ensures smoother recycling processes for glass items.
6. Sort Electronics and Batteries for Special Disposal:
Electronics and batteries contain hazardous materials and require special handling. Look for electronic recycling programs in your area.
7. Follow Your City’s Guidelines for Accepted Items:

Its small size can clog recycling equipment. Shredded paper is better suited for composting.
5. Never Mix Batteries or Hazardous Items with Recycling:
Batteries and chemicals release toxins during processing. Always dispose of them through special programs.
6. Don’t Recycle Mixed-Material Products:
Items like coffee cups (paper with a plastic lining) are too difficult to separate for effective recycling.
7. Avoid Plastic Toys in Standard Recycling Bins:
These often contain mixed materials that are not suitable for curbside recycling. Donate or find specialty recyclers.
8. Never Recycle Textiles:
Clothing and fabric can tangle machinery. Donate them or recycle through textile programs.
9. Don’t Recycle Wet or Contaminated Paper:
Moisture and contaminants degrade paper fibers, making them unsuitable for recycling. Compost them instead.

Dos and Don’ts of Composting
Composting Dos
1. Compost Vegetable and Fruit Scraps:
These decompose quickly and add essential nutrients to the compost pile.
2. Add Coffee Grounds and Filters for Nitrogen:
Coffee grounds are a great nitrogen source, and most filters are compostable if they’re unbleached.
3. Chop Larger Items to Speed Up Decomposition:
Cut large items like watermelon rinds into smaller pieces for quicker breakdown.
4. Balance Greens and Browns for Optimal Composting:
Maintain a healthy ratio of nitrogen-rich greens to carbon-rich browns to keep your compost balanced and odor-free.
5. Aerate the Pile Regularly:
Turning the pile allows oxygen to reach all layers, promoting faster decomposition and preventing foul odors.

Composting Don’ts
1. Avoid Meat or Dairy:
These items attract pests and create unpleasant odors in your compost.
2. Don’t Add Glossy or Coated Paper:
These often contain plastic or harmful chemicals that won’t break down.
3. Avoid Diseased Plants:
Composting diseased plants can spread pathogens to healthy plants when you use the compost.
4. Don’t Compost Cooked Foods:
Cooked foods decompose slowly and attract unwanted pests.
5. Never Include Pet Waste:
Pet waste contains harmful bacteria and pathogens unsuitable for composting.
Myths About Recycling
1. Myth: All plastics are recyclable.
Fact: Only certain plastics (like #1, #2, and #5) are widely accepted. Plastics like #3 (PVC) and #6 (polystyrene) are rarely recycled.
2. Myth: You don’t need to clean recyclables.
Fact: Dirty recyclables can contaminate entire batches, sending them to landfills. Always rinse items before recycling.
